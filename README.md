# 📚 42-Day Machine Learning Beginner Roadmap

Welcome! 👋  
This repository documents my **42-day journey** of learning Machine Learning — starting from Python basics, moving through data handling with NumPy & Pandas, core ML algorithms, and ending with a touch of Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs).  

The goal is simple: **Learn, Practice, Document, Share.**

## 🗺️ Roadmap
I am following a structured **42-day plan**:  

- **Week 1:** Python Revision  
- **Week 2:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn  
- **Week 3:** Core ML (Regression, Classification, Decision Trees, Random Forests)  
- **Week 4:** More ML Algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Clustering, PCA)  
- **Week 5:** End-to-End ML Projects (Feature engineering, Pipelines, Regularization)  
- **Week 6:** Deep Learning (NNs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transfer Learning)
